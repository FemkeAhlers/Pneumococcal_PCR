## Abstract of upcoming publication
The accurate identification of *Streptococcus pneumoniae* (pneumococcus) is crucial for global disease surveillance, but is complicated by the misidentification of non-pneumococcal *Streptococcus* (NPS) species. The aims of this study were to use large datasets of pneumococci and NPS genomes to assess the sensitivity and specificity of commonly used pneumococcal molecular gene targets, improve PCR assays where necessary, and validate the new assays *in vitro*. We found that Xisco and SP2020 were the most accurate pneumococcal targets, and designed qPCR assays targeting these genes. Experimentally, our Xisco and SP2020 assays were able to detect down to two pneumococcal genome copies per well consistently. We tested our new qPCR assays alongside published assays targeting *lytA*-CDC and *piaB* on three *in vitro* panels. *In vitro* sensitivity was analysed on 246 pneumococci from the 2022 United Kingdom Health Security Agency surveillance collection, finding a sensitivity of 100% [CI95% 98.5-100%] for the Xisco, SP2020 and *lytA*-CDC assays, and a sensitivity of 99.6% [CI95% 97.8-100%] for *piaB*. No cross-reactivity was found testing the *in vitro* specificity panel of 277 isolates of 21 NPS species for any of the assays, resulting in a specificity of 100% [CI95% 98.7-100%]. Finally, we exploited a dataset of 6,090 pneumococci of which both the whole genome sequence and the isolate itself were available to create a panel (n=248) with maximised amplicon diversity for all assays of interest to test *in vitro*, confirming the Xisco and SP2020 assays performed well across a range of different amplicons.
